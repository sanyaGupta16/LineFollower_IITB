# LineFollower_IITB
A line follower bot is an autonomous robot designed to navigate along a predetermined path marked by a black line on a white surface. It typically comprises an Arduino Uno microcontroller board and QTR sensors. These QTR sensors are infrared (IR) sensors that detect the contrast between the black line and its surrounding area.

The working principle of the line follower bot involves using the IR sensors to continuously monitor the position of the black line underneath it. Based on the sensor readings, the robot adjusts the speed and direction of its motors to ensure that it stays on the line. By making real-time adjustments, the robot is able to autonomously follow the path laid out by the black line.
